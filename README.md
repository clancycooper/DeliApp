## Project Overview
Welcome to Scooby’s Snack Shack, a delightful sandwich ordering platform designed to bring the essence of Mystery Inc. into the world of sandwich artistry. This application allows users to effortlessly place their customized sandwich orders, receive confirmations, and indulge in additional toppings for a truly groovy taste experience. Our deli app also ensures a hassle-free transaction process by conveniently saving users' receipts to a new text file for future reference.

## Key Features and Usage
- Sandwich Ordering: Our intuitive interface allows users to select from a wide range of bread, sauces, meats, cheeses, and our house made munchy toppings! For those craving extra flavor, the app offers a selection of premium toppings available for an upcharge.
  
- Receipt Management: Our application ensures users have a record of their orders by saving detailed receipts to a new .txt file. This feature enables easy access to past orders for reference or reordering. Upon placing an order, users receive immediate confirmation, providing assurance that their sandwich preferences have been successfully received and are being processed.
  
- Usage: Scooby's Snack Shack is ready to run, simply launch the app and enter your sandwich order by following the menu prompts in the command line. You'll be guided through the process, allowed to add as many or as few topping as you're hungry for, and given a second chance to make changes to your order before the kitchen gets to work. Following your written confirmation, our database will be automatically updated with a file of your customized order and total charges. Your receipt will include the date and time of your purchase!

## Acknowledgments
This project was only made possible by the combined efforts of each of our contributors. We would like to dedicate this section to the heart and backbone of Scooby's Snack Shack, The Gang.

### Erik Holden

- Sandwich Class: The foundation of our sandwiches
- Item Class: Parent to each item on our menu
- Item Interface: The interface which implemented the getPrice() method

  In addition to these crucial responsibilites, Erik was a work horse for this project. He was constantly testing our application, pushing fixes, and assisting his colleagues. His technical skills are boundless, his love for programming shines in his work, and he is a deeply valued member of our team for his communication, cooperation and attention to detail.
### Andi Burke

- Toppings Class: Premium, Regular and Munchy toppings, plus sauces, meats, and cheeses

  Creator of the Munchy Toppings! Andi was tasked with the toppings class, which required a substantial amount of work. They easily shouldered this responsibility with a smile on their face! They brought a creative energy to the project that contributed heavily to our final menu. Andi's suggestions led to constant improvements in our app, they brought an infectious energy that kept our team motivated to push through challenges and create the best version of Scooby's Snack Shack.
### Steven Crutchfield

- User Interface: The connection between our logic and the users' experience

  Steven's assignment was one that was ever shifting as new features were added. His role demanded constant communication with his team in order to correctly implement each class into the users' experience. This role could've easily overwhelmed any developer, but Steven was headstrong in his work. He was a fast and responsive communicator, dedicated any of his spare time to studying the code in other classes for better implementation, and worked tirelessly to make improvements as the project progressed. Without Steven, our app would be a blank command line instead of the interactive app you see today.
### Clancy Long

- Chip and Drink Classes: Additions to a customer's sandwich order
- Receipt Manager: The class that houses our displayOrder() and saveReceipts() methods

  In addition to the above classes, Clancy also developed the README, hosted the repository, and created the project board for an efficient team based workflow. With a knack for project management and design, he aided his colleagues in keeping to the project timeline, delivering a user friendly design, and bringing the project's theme to life.

### A massive round of applause to our dedicated team, whose collaboration, creativity, and hard work made this incredible project a reality.
